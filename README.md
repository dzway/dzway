# Hey, I'm Dan 👋

Welcome to my corner of the internet — a blend of logic, creativity, curiosity, and code. 


## 🔧 What I Do

- 🧠 **DevOps & Hacking**  
  I build, break, automate, and secure things.
  
- ☁️ **Cloud & Infrastructure**  
  Terraforming clouds and dancing with containers in distributed orchestras.

- 🃏 **Poker & Strategy**  
  Mind games, odds, and calculated risks — the mental dojo I thrive in.

- 🎨 **Creative Works**  
  Poems, drawings, music, code experiments — all powered by creativity and shared freely.

- 🏋️‍♂️ **Sports & Mindset**  
  Movement, discipline, and thriving with intention.

## 📂 Featured Tools & Projects

- 🛠️ `digit` – A CLI to help you to dig into git history and make it grepable  
- 📊 `wannabeCI` – A tool to build and test your project locally

## ✍️ Elsewhere On The Web

I leave breadcrumbs of thought scattered around the internet.  
You might find me sharing:

- **Articles & Writings**: Tech, philosophy, strategy, mindset  
- **Poetry & Music**: Expression over perfection  
- **Drawings**: Visual stories and symbolic sketches

Curious? Reach out, follow the rabbit hole, or just vibe with the silence between the lines.

## 🧭 Living With Intention

> "Creativity is intelligence having fun." – Einstein (probably)

I follow truth, curiosity, and growth.  
My life is a sandbox. I build with purpose, explore with play, and iterate with intention.
